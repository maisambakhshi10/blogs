## Further notes

This app contains the following basic functionalities

- routes
- observables to retrieve data
- services
- modules for posts
- pipes
- directives

Due to the time constraints I kept the functionalities very simple, If I had more time to implement, I would have implemented the followings

- search bar to search for products
- filter/sort products using RxJS operations
- implemented state-management with actions, reducers, effects and selectors.
- lazy loading for routes
- implemented SCAM module pattern if it was larger application
- shared components to re-use across the app
- smart components for retrieving data and dumb components.
- micro-frontend architecture for independencies of features
